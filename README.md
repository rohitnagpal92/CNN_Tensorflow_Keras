# Python Code for Convolutional Neural Netwrok (CNN) using Tensorflow
Find attached the python script for CNN using API keras through tensorflow version 2.0.0. From the tensorflow version 2.0.0 onwards keras is now offically a part of tensorflow as API.
In the code, I am using the MNIST dataset which is provided by keras daatsets. This is the data of around 10,000 images in which each image containss a number between 0 to 9.

The objective is to train the model through Convulutional and Dense layers such that the model can predict the number of incoming new images.

Following are the steps performed in the attached script:
a) MNIST data import as Train and Test
b) Scaling and Categorising the images
c) Building the model using Dense, Conv2D and MaxPool2D layers
d) Training the model on Train data
e) Generate predictions using Test data
f) Evaluate the model's predictions

Hope this helps !

Thanks :)
